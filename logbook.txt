NEW PID: more focus on facial recognition, less on image analysis
Submit New PID

research on pytorch, I much prefer it to tensorflow. I think this is how I am going to progress

conversion of vggface model from torch to pytorch using https://github.com/clcarwin/convert_torch_to_pytorch/issues/56

[10 January 2023]
vggface model doesnt work

[12 January 2023]
scrap use of vggface model -> going to use the facenet pytorch library

[14 January 2023]
begin implementation of facenet-pytorch model

[24 January 2023]
first succesful training run of the model after countless bugs and errors
needs to bre trained further to achieve a suitable level of accuracy

first succesful test with 42.5% accuracy

[28 January 2023]
wrote the ability for the train and test scripts to log their output as text files

[03 February 2023]
wrote skin segmentation script to detect faces <- hopefully this will work with occluded faces
uploaded to github

[06 February 2023]
wrote script to add occlusion to faces to train and test model on
occluded faces in dataset with 8 different occlusion locations
